          <p>  <!-- About Us par#1-->
               Our names are Kaushik, Alan, and Tiberius and we are group of student currently attending Dublin High School.
           Each of us have had our own unique problems regarding the disfunctionality of our alarm clock. Once the alarm 
           goes off, turning it off is very convinient and this does not actually wake a person up. In fact, it has become so convenient 
           that it has become an instinct to turn off the alarm for many people, which goes against the purpose of one. Thus, people could 
           easily just go back to sleep after snoozing their alarm, making them late to either their job, school, or any activity they have 
           planned. In conclusion, we believe that the conventional alarm clock is ineffective in waking up people, as it does not require 
           much effort to turn it off.
           </p>
            <h1 class='text-center'><strong>Our Solution </strong></h1>

           <p> To solve this problem, we decided to create an alarm clock that stimulates the user's brain while getting them physically active.
           In order to do this, our alarm clock has 2 components: the clock and a sensor. Once the alarm goes off, the user will have to walk
           to the motion sensor in order to disarm it. Once the motion sensor has detected motion, it will then direct the user back to the
           clock, which will then display a simple math problem. Once the user solves it, it will then turn off the alarm. This practice
           ensures that the person is both fully physically and mentally awake when they start their day. They will have no desire to go 
           back to sleep, which fulfill's the purpose of an alarm clock.
           </p>
                <h1 class='text-center'><strong>Why Us? </strong></h1>
            <p>Why should you buy our product over the hundreds of other clocks in the market? Our clock, the Room Clock, stimulates
            muscles in the brain in order to wake up the user mentally. Additionally, our clock also encourages physical activity, 
            as it reuires the user to go to a motion sensor before deactivating. There is also no harsh, beeping sound that agigitates the
            user, but rather a soft melody. This melody still wakes the user, but with out the unnecessary startling. Our clock also
            displays the time, weather, and date. Overall, this clock is very easy to use, functional, and unique, making it the best
            clock on the market</p>
